/**
Question: Find the Most Frequent Element

Problem Statement:
Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns the element that appears most frequently in the array. If two or more elements have the same highest frequency, the function should return the element that appears first in the array. If the array is empty, the function should return null.

Example Input and Output:

Input: [3, 7, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1]
Output: 2 (because 2 appears four times, more than any other element)

Input: [8, 70, 8, 50, 38, 70, 50, 50]
Output: 50 (both 50 and 70 appear three times, but 50 appears first)

Input: []
Output: null (the array is empty)


Constraints:
-The array may contain positive and negative integers.
-The function should be optimized for readability and efficiency.

Suggestions for implementation:
You can use an object to count the occurrences of each element, then determine the element with the maximum count that appears first if there is a tie. This problem checks the candidate's ability to manipulate arrays and objects, essential skills for full stack developers.

This type of question assesses basic programming logic, familiarity with JavaScript data structures, and problem-solving skills which are crucial for a junior developer role.

Approach
-I want to solve for the simplest case first, like what I get an empty array or if I get an array with just one item
